BRANCH

When you create a branch in your project, you're creating an environment where you can try out new ideas.
Changes you make on a branch don't affect the master branch, so you're free to experiment and commit changes,
safe in the knowledge that your branch won't be merged until it's ready to be reviewed by someone you're collaborating with.

PULL

Pull Requests initiate discussion about your commits.
Because they're tightly integrated with the underlying Git repository, anyone can see exactly what changes would be merged if they accept your request.
